# AutoLocum Excel-Automator [BETA]

A table reader of .xlsx files and converter to python dict (as of now)
Originnaly meant for the sole purpose of a said timetable format but soon recreated to be capable of taking in all values of intersecting rows and columns 

to do this:
- Open the `Modules` directory
- Open `configuration.py`
- change the value of the rows (`rows`) and columns (`columns_chartype_id`) arrays to your requiered rows and columns respectivly
- the program shall read all intersecting columns for each row that is given

#### Since this program was tailoured for a purpose, I cannot assure you it will work without poking around
##### Note: the coulmns should be their respective CHAR type as shown in Excel and are limitation of the columns from A-Z
###### No such restriction exists for rows except they should be positive intergers but hey they anyway are in excel too :")
